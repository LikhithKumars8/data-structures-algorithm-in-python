# Data structures and Algorithms using Python.

DSA, short for Data Structures and Algorithms, is a core subject in Computer Science. 
It involves the study of how to organize and store data in a computer, and how to efficiently perform operations on it.

Data structures are specific formats for organizing and storing data, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
Choosing the appropriate data structure for a specific task can greatly improve the efficiency of an algorithm.

Algorithms, on the other hand, are sets of instructions for accomplishing a task. 
They can be as simple as a recipe for baking a cake or as complex as the process a GPS system uses to calculate the shortest route to a destination. 
Algorithms are usually designed to work with specific data structures.
